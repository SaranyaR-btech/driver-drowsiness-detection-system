# driver-drowsiness-detection-system
##  PROBLEM STATEMENT
The driver drowsiness detection system addresses several significant problems related to drowsy driving, including:
Drowsy driving contributes to a significant number of road accidents each year. Drivers who are fatigued or drowsy have slower reaction times, impaired judgment, and decreased awareness, increasing the likelihood of collisions, injuries, and fatalities.
Accidents caused by drowsy driving can result in severe injuries or fatalities for drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and other road users. These accidents often have devastating consequences for individuals and families affected by the loss or injury of a loved one.
Drowsy driving accidents incur substantial economic costs, including medical expenses, property damage, lost productivity, legal fees, and insurance claims. These costs burden individuals, businesses, and society as a whole, impacting economic productivity and well-being.
Drowsy driving accidents can lead to legal consequences for drivers, including citations, fines, license suspension, and civil lawsuits. Moreover, there are regulatory challenges in enforcing laws and regulations related to drowsy driving, as it can be difficult to detect and prove drowsiness as a contributing factor in accidents.


## OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION 
 Our invention aims to revolutionize road safety by addressing the critical issue of drowsy driving through an innovative driver drowsiness detection system. At its core, our objective is clear: to create a solution that effectively detects signs of driver drowsiness and alerts them promptly, preventing potential accidents and saving lives.By integrating eyeblink sensors into various types of eyewear, including spectacles and sunglasses, our invention provides a discreet and convenient way to monitor the driver's alertness levels in real-time. This continuous monitoring allows our system to detect subtle changes in blinking patterns, a key indicator of drowsiness or fatigue.One of our primary goals is to enhance driver awareness of their own alertness levels. By providing timely alerts when signs of drowsiness are detected, we empower drivers to take proactive measures to combat fatigue, such as taking a break or switching drivers if necessary.

 Accessibility is also a key consideration in our design. We aim to create a system that is easy to wear and adaptable to different preferences and needs. Whether someone wears prescription glasses or prefers sunglasses, our solution can be seamlessly integrated into their eyewear of choice.Accessibility is also a key consideration in our design.
